# 📊 Quantitative Finance Projects

Welcome to my Quantitative Finance portfolio! 

This repository contains a collection of projects developed both as part of a structured Quant course and through my own independent learning. These projects reflect my continued efforts to build a strong foundation in quantitative analysis, financial modelling, and Python programming following the completion of my Master’s project at Imperial College London.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is a showcase of my practical work in quantitative finance. It includes coursework as well as personal projects, all written independently with a focus on clarity, reproducibility, and strong programming practices.

The goal is to demonstrate my problem-solving skills, mathematical understanding, and hands-on coding ability to potential employers and collaborators.

## 🧠 Project Overview

### Core Course Projects

These projects were developed as part of a Quantitative Finance course:

- **Options Pricing**  
  Implementation of Black-Scholes pricing, the Greeks, binomial trees, and Monte Carlo simulations.

- **Normal Returns and CAPM**  
  Statistical analysis of log returns, portfolio metrics, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model using market and asset data.

- **Daily Return Analysis**  
  Time series visualisation and exploration of real market data using tools like yfinance, pandas, and matplotlib.

More course-based projects will be added as I continue progressing through the material.

### Independent Projects

These are additional projects I’ve built to strengthen and extend my understanding:

**Crypto Price Anomaly (MVP)**
*a self-designed, end-to-end crypto-momentum research pipeline (BTC & ETH, 30-min bars)*

* Built a **config-driven Python package** (pandas / NumPy / ccxt) that auto-pulls Binance OHLCV data, engineers Z-score anomaly features, generates trading signals, and back-tests them with fee modelling and position-sizing.
* Wrote a **lightweight back-test engine** (≈150 LOC) delivering equity curves, Sharpe, max draw-down and hit-rate, plus a one-click notebook workflow for parameter sweeps.
* Followed **software-engineering best practice**: modular `src/`, YAML config, pre-commit (ruff + black), PyTest smoke tests, and GitHub Actions CI — green-badge ready.
* **Data-science skillset showcased**: time-series resampling, rolling-window statistics, anomaly detection, vectorised PnL attribution, matplotlib visualisation.
* Extension roadmap prepared (adaptive thresholds, volume confirmation, live paper-trading loop), demonstrating forward-thinking project management and product mindset.
 

## 💡 Why I Built This

After completing a data-driven Master’s project involving statistical modelling and computational methods, I developed a strong interest in quantitative finance. This repository represents my personal learning journey and commitment to building a career in this field.

All code is my own work, and I take great care to ensure it is well-structured, accurate, and reflective of good analytical thinking.

## ⚙️ Tools and Technologies

- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, yfinance, SciPy, scikit-learn, pytorch, JAX)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git and GitHub for version control
- VS Code for development and visualisation

## 📈 What's Next

Upcoming projects will include:

- Time series forecasting models  
- Multi-factor models such as Fama-French  
- Advanced portfolio optimisation techniques  
- Options trading strategies with interactive dashboards  
- Event-driven backtesting with market data
